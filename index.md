Hi, my name is Harold (Harry) and I am from Ann Arbor, Michigan and graduated from East Lansing's Michigan State University. Go Green!

The first time I was introduced to coding and data analysis was when I was taking courses in Computer Science and Engineering at my university. Though I ended up receiving my bachelor's degree in Pre-Medicine, I came back to my fond memories of computer science. I began to take online classes for mySQL and python and reading documentation on packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and tensorflow. Currently, I am a data analyst who cleans market data for jobs, performs correlary analysis regarding internal equity, proposes changes backed by exploratory analysis to existing compensation plans, and visualizes data for executives. Data analytics and data science may not be what I graduated with from college, but it is now my career future. It is what I want to be doing. It is what I know I can do best.

Aside from data, I enjoy making illustrations on my tablet, partaking in the rollercoaster of the stock market, playing games with friends, brewing coffee, and building mechanical keyboards.
