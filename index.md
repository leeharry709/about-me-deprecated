My name is Harold (Harry), and I am from Ann Arbor, Michigan and graduated from East Lansing's Michigan State University. Go Green!

I started college with an undecided major until deciding on Computer Science and Engineering at the beginning of my 2nd year. It started with Excel formulas, information theory, and python. Creating code in python was fun! I enjoyed the now-simple tasks of creating hangman and blackjack and using Excel speadsheets and csv files to create dataframes. After about 2 regular and 2 summer semesters of computer science, the frustration got to me. Spending hours on a single program only to see it fail week after week weighted heavily on me. Even though it was a joy and a sigh of relief to see the program work, it didn't outweigh the frustration. I ended up changing majors. I went into Physics. I enjoyed learning about the forces of nature and how the world works down to a quantum level. Math was never scary to me, rather it was exciting and a fun challenge! But, this major was also cut short after 1 year due to a disagreement with my parents. With their guidance, I chose Pre-Med as my final major. With a conviction to graduate, I went all-in on Pre-Med and graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Pre-Medicine. Once I got out of school, I lost the drive to become a doctor and turned back to what I enjoyed in college - Coding and writing formulas to simplify life.

An epiphany hit me shortly after - Maybe I was so frustrated and also having so much fun with coding because it was something I was truly passionate about. If I wasn't passionate about it, I would be indifferent. I would not care so much about the outcome. But, I felt a fire inside to pursue this perceived passion, learning packages and making programs. I felt that frustration of debugging failing codes again but also the elation of seeing it work as intended. It didn't weigh nearly as heavily on me. I had a clearer mindset more determined to learn from my failures than to give up. Seeing barcharts from matplotlib, dataframes from pandas, correlary heat maps from seaborn, and neural networks from tensorflow come to life fuel the fire in me to keep improving and keep learning. Yes, this is my passion.

Data analytics and data science is not what I graduated with from college, but it is my career future. It is what I want to be doing. It is what I know I can do best.

Aside from data, I enjoy making illustrations on my tablet, partaking in the rollercoaster of the stock market, playing games with friends, brewing coffee, and building mechanical keyboards.
